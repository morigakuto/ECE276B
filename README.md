# ECE276B Project 2

This repository tracks my work for the ECE276B Project 2 assignment, including starter planners, experiments, and figures.

- `ECE276B_PR2_report.pdf` is the project report that summarizes the final methods, experiments, and results.
- `starter_code/` holds the provided planning templates plus my implementations (e.g., `astar.py`, `rrt.py`, and `Planner.py`).
- `paper/` contains the LaTeX sources and scripts used to regenerate figures for the report if needed.

Open the PDF to read the report, or dive into the code and paper directories for implementation details and reproducibility.
